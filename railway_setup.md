# Railway Database Setup (No Credit Card Required!)

Railway offers free MySQL/MariaDB hosting perfect for your memory graph project.

## Step 1: Create Railway Account (Free)

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Click **"Start a New Project"**
3. Sign up with **GitHub** (no credit card needed)
4. Verify email if prompted

## Step 2: Create Database

1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Provision MySQL"** 
3. Wait for deployment (takes ~2 minutes)
4. Click on the **MySQL service** that appears

## Step 3: Get Connection Details

In your MySQL service dashboard:
1. Go to **"Connect"** tab
2. Copy these values:
   ```
   MYSQL_HOST=containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app
   MYSQL_PORT=6543
   MYSQL_USERNAME=root
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your-generated-password
   MYSQL_DATABASE=railway
   ```

## Step 4: Import Your Data

### Option A: Using phpMyAdmin (Easiest)
1. In Railway dashboard, click **"Add Service"** â†’ **"Deploy a Template"**
2. Search for **"phpMyAdmin"** and deploy it
3. Connect using the database credentials above
4. Import your `lang_memories` database dump

### Option B: Using MySQL Client
```bash
# Export your current database
mysqldump -u root -p lang_memories > lang_memories_backup.sql

# Import to Railway (replace with your Railway credentials)
mysql -h containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app -P 6543 -u root -p railway < lang_memories_backup.sql
```

## Step 5: Add to Netlify Environment Variables

In Netlify Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

```
DB_HOST=containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app
DB_PORT=6543
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your-railway-password
DB_NAME=railway
```

## Step 6: Test Connection

1. **Deploy** your Netlify site with new environment variables
2. **Check browser console** - should see "Loading live data from database..."
3. **Verify** your memory graph loads with live data!

## Alternative: Quick Local Export Method

If Railway setup seems complex, you can stick with the current static approach and just refresh manually:

```bash
# In Lang directory
python3 export_graph.py

# Copy the updated memories.json to your Netlify deployment
# Re-deploy to Netlify
```
